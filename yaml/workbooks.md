   name: apple
   ```
   Add some additional properties (given below) to the dictionary.
   color= red
   weight= 90g

7) There is a yaml file named practice3.yaml dictionary named employee. 

   ```

  ```
  employee:

      address:
        city: 'edison'
        state: 'new jersey'
        country: 'united states'
    ```

    Now add the pay information. Remember, while address is a dictionary, payslips is an array of month and amount.
    
     ```
    payslips
    ```
    

    | Month  | amount |
    |--------|--------|
    | june | 1400   |
    | July | 2400   |
